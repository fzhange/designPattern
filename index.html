    //     Node.js isn't dying. Choose your words wisely.
    //      Do you know that team working for making node.js better by every version is unpaid ? While bun is VC funded.
    // Bun has implemented lots of things from nodejs and it's doesn't mean bun faster in everything.
    //       FYI, I tried `sharp` and bun didn't supported that library.
    //        I had to use pnpm to install that lib but still bun kept on giving me lots of errors.
    //        There are lots of modules which will needs to be rebuilt for bun.
    // You should also check how bun package manager and pnpm works.
    //       There's a big difference which made bun to install modules faster than pnpm.
    // I guess you have to do a research on how pnpm verifies package and how bun does it.
    // Plus there are lots of memory issues with bun which I faced and because
    // of which I had to migrate to nodejs for that same project.Bun is good,
    //       but to say that nodejs is dying is a big insult to devs who are working to make it better.
